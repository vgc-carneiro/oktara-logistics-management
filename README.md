# Logistics Management System - By Vinicius Carneiro

## Description

This project is responsible to manage the storage, inventory, and transportation of packages.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) >= 20
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) >= 1.29

## Running the app

### IMPORTANT

Before the execution, there are two steps to consider:
1. This project uses a [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation), so for the complete use of the functions developed here, you **must** put your [credential key](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#api-key) in the file: **./web-logistics/src/shared/components/Map/key.ts**

2. The Warehouse location is: **latitude: -23.315089, longitude: -51.175864**, therefor is **strongly** recommended to use packages location near the Warehouse location.

### Docker
For executing the project, you just need to run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
This **Docker Compose** will create a PostgreSQL database and will seed some information.
